### Chapter 1: Accounting Equation
* Assets = Liability + Shareholder's Equity
  - cash: coins, checks, money orders, and checking account balances

* Net income = Revenue - Expense
  - *B* beginning balance
  - *A* add revenue
  - *S* substract expense
  - *E* ending balance
* Cash <- Cash + Net increase in cash.

* net income: operating income + non-operating income
* gross profit/margin ratio: gross margin / net sales

#### Depreciation
* Straight line (easiest, most common)
* Units of activity (most accurate)
* declining balance method: twice the rate of straight line
  - last year takes the residual, do not depreciate below salvage
* DR depreciation expense, CR accumulated depreciation

#### intangible Asset
